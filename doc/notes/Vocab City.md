- could use something like 
    - metro lines for topics
    - helicopter for connections
    - ...extend others for other kind of transport
    - fence/Sichtschutz = opposite
    - what about variations (e.g. plural)? A shed in the garden? An annex?


- how to diegetically test/do SR runs?

- if you have an image, make it fade so you are incentived to "clean" it so you actually learn?

- could use something like flags/cars in the driveway/other decoration to allow tags

- how does Factorio manage that you can see so much complexity with so few pixels?

- maybe wouldn't be too bad if stuff becomes bigger for longer words. looks better, micro-tile system, more alive...
    - does come with complexity of the tiles, of course
    - but does make stuff like 1-tile-wide streets possible easily

- how about a fun fact building where you can talk about special rules, grammar, ...


- could use [this tut](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3cGrGHvkwn3zyVj-lHM1aGYhNv8E0HBS) to learn about eco and what not

- big problem now: SR isn't integrated into real game flow, so...why bother
    - maybe first step: SR game is a "building", not a UI you can open
        - would be diegetic, almost Factorio level manual farming
            - ...but where is the automation satisfaction later on?
            - or is this whole thing solved when economy motivates me? And connections how?
                - no, more specifically, how do I get myself to *revisit* tiles...?


- how about this: create connections by UI, and just have generic whatever drones fly between and see if this is fun, maybe in connection to eco somehow
